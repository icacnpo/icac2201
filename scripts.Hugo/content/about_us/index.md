# 2021絕對是最壞的一年，也是最好的一年！

2021絕對是最壞的一年，也是最好的一年！

我們堅持，我們流血，我們加油！

滅族行動絕不能奪去我們的意志！

我們一班流散港人聚合起來，我們一班異鄉遊子出心錢出力，我們一班用正體說廣東話的文化保衛者團結一心，組成一個於美國註冊的非營利組織！籌備半年，沒花分毫，未求捐助，先做實務，我們今天向大家鄭重宣佈，華粵學院（Institute of Chinese And Cantonese NPO, Abbre:ICAC)）正式成立！

2021 is absolutely the worst year and it is also the best!

We persist. We shed blood. We “add oil”!
Our willpower has never been snatched by the act of genocide.

We, a group of diasporic HongKongers gathering together; a group of strangers in the foreign lands pouring our heart and might; a group of cultural warriors using Traditional Chinese and speaking Cantonese, unite to found a nonprofit organization registered in the United States to preserve our precious language heritage! During a 6-month preparation, we took the initiative to do the groundwork without asking for a penny of donation. Today, we solemnly announce that “Institute of Chinese and Cantonese NPO[a]” (abbre: ICAC, 華粵學院 in Chinese) has been officially established. It will start operating on January 1st, 2022.
